# C3Projects--Constellations

### Project Description

This project will be a single page site providing information on several constellations.  The audience for this page is myself or anyone else who wants to get some basic information on a limited number of constellations.  

### Learning Goals

The goal of this project is to spend more time working with javascript, jQuery and CSS, the technologies I intend to use, to make something interesting and fun to use.

### Completion

Success for this project is a page that looks good and has at least three constellations that move to the center of the page and has information about that constellation appear.
